Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year &lsquo;66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
