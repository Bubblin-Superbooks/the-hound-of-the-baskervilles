<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers&rsquo; ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall.</p></div> </div>
