Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I have only just come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, man!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare&rsquo;s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
