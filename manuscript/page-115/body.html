<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How can you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me a telegraph form. &lsquo;Is all ready for Sir Henry?&rsquo; That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: &lsquo;Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.&rsquo; That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Baskerville. &ldquo;By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
