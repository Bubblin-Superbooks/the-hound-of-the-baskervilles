<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles&rsquo;s study&mdash;it had never been touched since his death&mdash;and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was gray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said: &lsquo;Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed the initials L. L.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
