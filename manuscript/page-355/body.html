The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Henry&rsquo;s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
