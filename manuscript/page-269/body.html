<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near it&mdash;just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.</p><p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; whispered Sir Henry.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
