<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Running from what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the gipsy&rsquo;s evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
