It filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Queer place, the moor!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey. I&rsquo;ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
