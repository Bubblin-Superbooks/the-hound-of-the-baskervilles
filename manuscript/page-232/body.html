If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
