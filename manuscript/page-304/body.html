I have come here with no object except to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p><p>Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all these goings-on, sir,&rdquo; he cried at last, waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s foul play somewhere, and there&rsquo;s black villainy brewing, to that I&rsquo;ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
