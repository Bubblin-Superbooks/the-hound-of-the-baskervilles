The brute!&rdquo; I cried with clenched hands. &ldquo;Oh Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I know&mdash;how could I know&mdash;that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That we should have heard his screams&mdash;my God, those screams!&mdash;and yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
