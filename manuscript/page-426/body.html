<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes&rsquo;s face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s moving towards us, Watson.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that serious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very serious, indeed&mdash;the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans. He can&rsquo;t be very long, now. It is already ten o&rsquo;clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
