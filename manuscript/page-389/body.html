<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But how about the case?&rdquo; asked the baronet. &ldquo;Have you made anything out of the tangle? I don&rsquo;t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want light&mdash;but it is coming all the same.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I&rsquo;ll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
