I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton&rsquo;s park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We&rsquo;ll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners, confound them! And I&rsquo;ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and both in my favour.</p></div> </div>
