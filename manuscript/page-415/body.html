We all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything good?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The biggest thing for years,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;We have two hours before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don&rsquo;t suppose you will forget your first visit.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
