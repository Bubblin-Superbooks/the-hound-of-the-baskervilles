It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions.</p><p>&ldquo;To go to Baskerville Hall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At the end of the week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;I think that your decision is a wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it.
