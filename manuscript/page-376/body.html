It&rsquo;s the man himself, by all that&rsquo;s wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions&mdash;not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, Dr. Watson, that&rsquo;s not you, is it? You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But, dear me, what&rsquo;s this? Somebody hurt? Not&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!&rdquo; He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.</p></div> </div>
