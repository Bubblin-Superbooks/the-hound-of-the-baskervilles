A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.</p><p>&ldquo;One last question, Holmes,&rdquo; I said as I rose. &ldquo;Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he after?&rdquo;</p><p>Holmes&rsquo;s voice sank as he answered:</p><p>&ldquo;It is murder, Watson&mdash;refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. Another day&mdash;two at the most&mdash;and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child.</p></div> </div>
