Supposing that anything happened to our young friend here&mdash;you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis!&mdash;who would inherit the estate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles&rsquo;s younger brother died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr. James Desmond?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
