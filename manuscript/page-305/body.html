Look at the noises on the moor at night. There&rsquo;s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What&rsquo;s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry&rsquo;s new servants are ready to take over the Hall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But about this stranger,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Can you tell me anything about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
