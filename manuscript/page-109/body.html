His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find they&rsquo;ve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can&rsquo;t find my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they&rsquo;ve got a bit over the mark this time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
