<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister&rsquo;s suitor&mdash;even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an agent&mdash;that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these things have by one night&rsquo;s work been thoroughly cleared.</p></div> </div>
