<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver&rsquo;s private school. Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.&rdquo;</p><p>She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face of a desperate woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever told me. And why&mdash;why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back.</p></div> </div>
