How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry that he has seen you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
