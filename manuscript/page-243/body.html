<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should say not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I&rsquo;ve only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too&mdash;she was happy when she was with me, and that I&rsquo;ll swear. There&rsquo;s a light in a woman&rsquo;s eyes that speaks louder than words.</p></div> </div>
