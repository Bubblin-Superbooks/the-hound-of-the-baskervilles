Am I right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just as you wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They have treated me shamefully&mdash;shamefully. When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake.</p></div> </div>
