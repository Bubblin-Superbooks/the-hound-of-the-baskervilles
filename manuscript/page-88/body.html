<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots&mdash;gave six dollars for them&mdash;and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer&rsquo;s belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
