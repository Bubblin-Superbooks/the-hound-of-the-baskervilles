You will find hot water in your rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What new conditions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have more company, and so you will need changes in your household.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
