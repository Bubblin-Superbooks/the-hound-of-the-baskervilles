<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton&rsquo;s. I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations.</p><p>&ldquo;By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to a jury.</p></div> </div>
