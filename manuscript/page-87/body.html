<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;however foolish the incident may seem. You have lost one of your boots, you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put them out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
