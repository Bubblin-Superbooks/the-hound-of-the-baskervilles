<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Surely we have a case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a shadow of one&mdash;only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is Sir Charles&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
