We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our friend&rsquo;s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet&rsquo;s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.</p><p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;What was it? What, in heaven&rsquo;s name, was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead, whatever it is,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve laid the family ghost once and forever.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
