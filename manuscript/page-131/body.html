We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.

Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said: &lsquo;It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how I come to know the name.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
