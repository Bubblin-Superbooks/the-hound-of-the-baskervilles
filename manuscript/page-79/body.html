But I want to know why the word &lsquo;moor&rsquo; should have been written?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but &lsquo;moor&rsquo; would be less common.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you.</p></div> </div>
