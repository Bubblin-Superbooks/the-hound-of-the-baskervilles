He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.</p><p>&ldquo;Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles&rsquo;s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart&mdash;so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging.</p></div> </div>
