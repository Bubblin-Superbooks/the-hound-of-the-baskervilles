<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I presume nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch&rsquo;s body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
