<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have said &ldquo;by one night&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; but, in truth, it was by two nights&rsquo; work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander.</p></div> </div>
