There are lonely houses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton&rsquo;s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend it. There&rsquo;s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South America.</p></div> </div>
