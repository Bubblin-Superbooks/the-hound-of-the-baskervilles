<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Our driver half turned in his seat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a convict escaped from Princetown, sir. He&rsquo;s been out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every station, but they&rsquo;ve had no sight of him yet. The farmers about here don&rsquo;t like it, sir, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give information.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn&rsquo;t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
