<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have you been on the moor already?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at his master&rsquo;s grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the next move?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Holmes,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
