<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;She is Frankland&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! Old Frankland the crank?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
